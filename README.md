Webpage Description:

Design and Styling:

The background of the page is set with an image using a custom class bg-with-image.
Tailwind CSS classes are used extensively throughout the page to style elements such as text, inputs, buttons, etc.
The layout is responsive, thanks to Tailwind's utility classes and the use of max-w-md for the main content container.

Signup Form:

The form collects user information including name, email, and password.
Input fields are styled with appropriate classes for consistent appearance and user-friendly interaction.
Form validation is implemented with the required attribute on input fields, ensuring data completeness.

Animal Sound Identification:

Below the form, there's a section for users to identify an animal sound.
An audio element (<audio>) is included with controls to play the animal sound.
A dropdown (<select>) is provided for users to select the animal they think the sound belongs to.

JavaScript Functionality:

The JavaScript code dynamically populates the dropdown with animal options and associates each animal with its sound file.
When the page loads, a random animal sound is played to engage the user.
Upon form submission, the selected animal is checked against the played animal sound. If they match, a success message is shown; otherwise, an error message is displayed.

Focus on Correct Animal Voice:

The core functionality of the page revolves around correctly identifying the animal sound.
Users are prompted to listen to a random animal sound and select the corresponding animal from the dropdown.
If the selected animal matches the played sound, a success message is displayed, indicating a successful signup.
This interactive element adds an engaging and entertaining aspect to the signup process, making the page more memorable and enjoyable for users.
